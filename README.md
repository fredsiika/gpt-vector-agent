# 🧩 GPT Vector Agent

**WIP**

This is an experimental playground for interfacing with different LLMs-chains (via [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/)), vectorstores (via [Pinecone.io](https://pinecone.io)), and autonomous/chained agents.

## 🥅 Goals:

1. To ideate, and experiment potential use cases for generative AI
2. Provide public documention current understanding and lessons learned

## :memo: Prompt Design (Great resources)

1. [Prompt Engineering by learnprompting.org](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intro) - an open source introductory course on prompt engineering
2. [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) - Prompt engineering basics straight from OpenAI

## :parrot: :link: LangChain

1. [Welcome to LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/) - LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. 
  
  - Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
  - Be agentic: Allow a language model to interact with its environment 

2. [Six Main Components of LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/category/components):
  - 🗃️ Schema  (4 items)
  - 🗃️ Models  (3 items)
  - 🗃️ Prompts (4 items)
  - 🗃️ Indexes (4 items)
  - 🗃️ Memory  (1 items)
  - 🗃️ Chains  (4 items)
  - 🗃️ Agents  (4 items)
