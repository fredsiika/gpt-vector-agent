## Quickstart Guide

https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html

This tutorial gives you a quick walkthrough about building an end-to-end language model application with LangChain.

## Installation

To get started, install LangChain with the following command:

```sh
pip install langchain
# or
conda install langchain -c conda-forge
```

## Environment Setup

Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, apis, etc.

For this example, we will be using OpenAIâ€™s APIs, so we will first need to install their SDK:

```sh
pip install openai
```

We will then need to set the environment variable in the terminal.

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

Alternatively, you could do this from inside the Jupyter notebook (or Python script):

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
pip install openai
```
